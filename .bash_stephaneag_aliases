# This file is used to store alisases for command often used
# It is sourced on startup by "~/.bashrc"

# by StephaneAG - 2013 / 2015


## - aliases file related fcns -
# print the aliases in the terminal
alias stag_printaliases='cat ~/.bash_stephaneag_aliases'
# print the commands used within the alias or a fcn ( the latter is nicer because it display the type as well as the source )
#alias stag_printaliases_alias_source='alias'
#   example output: " alias stag__PDF_editor='/opt/MasterPDFEditor/master-pdf-editor &' "
alias stag_print_alias_source='type'
# the following line is used to override the default bash_completion ( <stuff>[tab][tab] ) in order to use commands as arg instead of dirs/files ( the default )
complete -c stag_print_alias_source
#   example output: " stag__PDF_editor is aliased to `/opt/MasterPDFEditor/master-pdf-editor &' "
# TO DO: work on a colored version of the above  & also add help to each of them ( maybe a fcn that prints the line(s) above an alias if they start with some specific stuff ex: "##help#" )
# source both aliases & fcn aliases
alias stag_sourceboth='stag_sourcealiases && stag_sourcefcnaliases'
# source the aliases ( makes recent changes available in the current console )
alias stag_sourcealiases='. ~/.bash_stephaneag_aliases'
# source the functions aliases ( makes recent changes available in the current console )
alias stag_sourcefcnaliases='. ~/.bash_stephaneag_functions'
# edit the aliases file with vim
alias stag_vimaliases='sudo vim ~/.bash_stephaneag_aliases'
